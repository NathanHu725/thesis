Some ideas of things to implement
- Using gravity or radiation, we can implement travel
- Using a queue, we can implement quarantines of different lengths for travelers
    - How does quarantine work differently from cutting off the travel 
    - Possibly think about not letting sick people travel 
        - Does one method do better at maintaining a regular level of commuting/travel
- Possibly have a differentiation between commuter travel and pleasure travel 
- Thinking about commuting will require some modifications of the network 
    - May have to have a day and night time-step, this would have positive and negative commuting (boolean)
    - Tourism obviously would be considered differently

- Look at the shared paper, see what we want to have for the gravity model
- The radiation model may just be a different implementation that we can also use


- Latin hypercube for parameters

- Should I do relative percentage of population?
